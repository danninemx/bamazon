# Bamazon

## Overview

This command line application is an eCommerce storefront simulation, built with NodeJS and MySQL.

It can:

- Take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory
- Track product sales across the store's departments and provide a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store.

## How to Use

1. Customers

```shell
node bamazonCustomer.js
```

Simply enter the desired item and quantity to place your order!

In case of low availability, you will be able to adjust your order quantity.

2. Managers

```shell
node bamazonManager.js
```

(3. and so on...)

### Challenge #3: Supervisor View (Final Level)

1. Create a new MySQL table called `departments`. Your table should include the following columns:

   - department_id

   - department_name

   - over_head_costs (A dummy number you set for each department)

2. Modify the products table so that there's a product_sales column, and modify your `bamazonCustomer.js` app so that when a customer purchases anything from the store, the price of the product multiplied by the quantity purchased is added to the product's product_sales column.

   - Make sure your app still updates the inventory listed in the `products` column.

3. Create another Node app called `bamazonSupervisor.js`. Running this application will list a set of menu options:

   - View Product Sales by Department

   - Create New Department

4. When a supervisor selects `View Product Sales by Department`, the app should display a summarized table in their terminal/bash window. Use the table below as a guide.

| department_id | department_name | over_head_costs | product_sales | total_profit |
| ------------- | --------------- | --------------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| 01            | Electronics     | 10000           | 20000         | 10000        |
| 02            | Clothing        | 60000           | 100000        | 40000        |

5. The `total_profit` column should be calculated on the fly using the difference between `over_head_costs` and `product_sales`. `total_profit` should not be stored in any database. You should use a custom alias.

6. If you can't get the table to display properly after a few hours, then feel free to go back and just add `total_profit` to the `departments` table.

   - Hint: You may need to look into aliases in MySQL.

   - Hint: You may need to look into GROUP BYs.

   - Hint: You may need to look into JOINS.

   - **HINT**: There may be an NPM package that can log the table to the console. What's is it? Good question :)
